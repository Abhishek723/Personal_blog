# Personal_blog
This is essentially the bare-minimum blog application; it has models for entries and a way to categorize them, some nice text-to-HTML conversion, and the necessary views and admin bits. I'm pretty happy with it, and will likely be extremely conservative about adding features; it's out here in public mainly to serve as a simple example of:

    A useful, reusable blog app, and
    A Django application which runs on both Python 2 and Python 3 (I personally deploy to Python 3.6).

However, it's BSD-licensed, so if you want to take it as a baseline for building your own blog with extra or different features, please feel free to do so
